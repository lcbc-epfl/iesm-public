\textbf{Exercise 1}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate the HF energy for Boron using the 6-311+G** basis set, then determine the value of the correlation energy for boron assuming an ``experimental'' energy of -24.608 Hartrees (\cite{schaefer_electronic_1968}).
\item Using the same basis set, perform an energy calculation with CISD and full CI.
\item Using the same basis set, perform an energy calculation with MP2, MP3 and MP5.
\item Using the same basis set, perform an energy calculation with CCSD and CCSD(T).
\end{itemize}

Determine the percentage of the correlation energy recovered for HF, MP2, MP5, CCSD, CCSD(T).

Compare the performances of the different methods. In particular, you will see that some of the methods seem to overestimate the correlation recovered. How is it possible? (\textit{Hint:} Think both about the theoretical aspects of the methods and \textit{how} we are computing the recovered correlation energy).

\textbf{Exercise 3}\\
Why is it a reasonable choice to use Hartree-Fock geometries and
wavefunctions as a starting point for optimisations at the
Post-Hartree-Fock level? What is the advantage and how is this
approach justified?

Is the homolytic cleavage of the H$_3$C-F bond likely, based on the
BDE that you calculated? (Think of radical processes in general.)

\textbf{Exercise 6}\\
What is the trend in energies when moving from HF over MP2 to MP3 for your calculations? Does this series converge? Do you expect the same trend for higher order MPn methods? Why?

\textit{Hint}: You can check the convergence for MP2 and MP3 by running the code cell below.

\textbf{Exercise 7}\\
Comment on the accuracy of the HF approach for this system. Is the
error associated with HF or with MPn bigger, and why?
(\textit{Hint}: Think in terms of the scale of the absolute energy of the
reaction, as well as of the different components of the system.)
