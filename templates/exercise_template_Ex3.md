```{admonition} Exercise 4
:class: exercise
Explain the physical origin of the difference between the two
    dissociation curves. Discuss how important this difference is by
    comparing to the energy that is normally required to break a bond.
```

```{admonition} Exercise 5 - Bonus
:class: exercise
Try to find out why we are using `guess_mix:True` and `'guess':'gwh'`. **Hint**: What happend if you use the same settings as for the RHF calculation?

You can also look at the Psi4 manual to find out about the different options for the initial guess.

```{admonition} Exercise 8
:class: excercise 
Try to start from two (or more!) different suboptimal geometries of water and include the plots of the potential energy surface in the report, together with a screenshot of the starting and final geometry and/or the values of the O-H bond and H-O-H angle. 

What do the points on the orange curve correspond to? Connect them to the flowchart at the beginning of this exercise?
