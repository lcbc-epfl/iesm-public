```{admonition} Exercise 3
:class: exercise    
Create a potential energy profile along the dihedral by plotting the
    energies of the system as a function of the scanned dihedral angle as done above.
    Then, to each maximum and minimum, assign the corresponding
    conformation from your trajectory. Show these conformations in your
    report.
    Assign also names to the conformations according to the *Newman
    projections* you know from organic chemistry (where possible).
