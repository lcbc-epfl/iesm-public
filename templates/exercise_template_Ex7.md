```{admonition} Exercise 5
:class: exercise
Before running the calculations, give your best estimate as to which of the reaction energies (i.e. the energy difference between product and reactants) do you think is most "difficult" to calculate? Rank them in order of increasing difficulty and explain the reasoning behind your choices. 

Difficult in this case refers to getting an accurate reaction energy with low absolute error to true energy (reference energy from the dataset). As chemical accuracy we usually use 1 kcal mol$^-1$
