```{admonition} Exercise 1
:class: exercise 
What kind of reaction mechanism would you expect? Would you expect
    the stereochemistry at the chiral carbon to be preserved? Identify
    the chirality centre in the chloropropanoate and the product
    epoxide.

```{admonition} Exercise 2
:class: exercise 
Suggest possible transition state structures.

```{admonition} Exercise 3
:class: exercise 
Include a screenshot of the transition state in your report that you obtained and the corresponding Z-matrix for the transition state guess
```

Your answer here

```{admonition} Exercise 4
:class: exercise
Take a screenshot of the optimised transition state structure. How did the structure change with respect to the constrained-optimised guess?
```

```{admonition} Exercise 4
:class: exercise
Report the value of the negative frequency that you obtain.  What motion is this mode related to?
What motions are associated with low and high vibrational frequencies? Choose two positive vibrational modes and desribe their particular associated motion.
```

```{admonition} Exercise 5
:class: exercise
Is the transition state you predicted an early or a late transition state? What about the guess?
```

```{admonition} Exercise 6
:class: exercise
Having found a transition state, how would you now obtain the barrier height for your reaction? Are there ways of verifying whether you have found a meaningful
    transition state? **Bonus:** How would you define 'meaningful' in
    this context?
```

```{admonition} Exercise 8
:class: exercise
Is the stereochemistry at the carbon at which the reaction takes
    place retained?
```


Your answer here

```{admonition} Exercise 7
:class: exercise
Take a screenshot of the graph of the potential energy profile you
    recorded. 
Why is the barrier for the epoxide formation so low? Will this be
    the overall barrier for the reaction as depicted in the previous section?
```

```{admonition} Exercise  9
:class: exercise
How do the C-Cl and the two relevant C-O bond lengths change during
    the trajectory? Does the C-C bond in the ring contract as the
    epoxide is formed? Show a graph depicting the evolution of these
    parameters as the reaction progresses. 
```

```{admonition} Exercise 10
:class: exercise
What is happening to the methyl group as the reaction proceeds? Find
    a suitable parameter (angle, dihedral) to describe and characterise
    possible changes you observe, change the code below. Explain in your report what atoms you considered and take and include the evolutions of the chosen parameters during the IRC procedure.
