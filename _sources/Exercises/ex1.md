# Linear Algebra in Quantum Mechanics

This chapter summarises concepts that you are familiar with from your
linear algebra and quantum mechanics courses and that are the most
relevant to computational chemistry. It is meant as a review rather than
an introduction. The first paragraphs deal with the fundamental
concepts, and practical examples in quantum mechanics shall be given
towards the end of the chapter along with a set of exercises. (For those
interested, some additional information is given in parentheses; you may
find this useful if you ever wish to go through the literature.)
