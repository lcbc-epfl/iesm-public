    "In order to do DFT calculations we use an integration grid when evaluating the exchange–correlation integrals. There are many integration schemes around. Most of them calculate the integrals as weighted sum over a finite amount of grid points generally defined on the surface of a sphere. The “thickness” of these grids is usually represented by the corresponding number of radial and angular points. The choice of the grid can significantly affect the computed results.\n",
    "The SG-0 and SG-1 (pruned 50,194 with < 40% of the points of the full grid) grids were optimized for an integration error in the energy to fall below a target threshold. Unfortunately, derivatives of the energy (eg. (hyper)polarizabilities) are often more sensitive to the quality of the integration grid. \n",
    "This is also true when imaginary vibrational frequencies or  PES curves of non-bonded interactionsare are calculated. If the grid is low quality,  low-frequency (but real) vibrational frequencies might manifest as imaginary and PES curves might contain artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recent functionals developed since ~2005 often depend on the kinetic energy density or the laplacian of the density (e.g Meta-GGA functionals) and require finer grids than GGA functionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of choosing the most appropriate integration grid is often overlooked. Relying on the default settings of quantum chemistry programs is not a good idea, even if some developers implemented variable grid requirements that depend on the chosen functional (e.g in Q-Chem). In this experiment we will look at the dissociation curve of the argon dimer, between 3.0 and 6.0 Ångström using psi4 which uses the medium quality 75, 302 grid as default. \n",
