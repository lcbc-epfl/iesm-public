# Large Basis Sets, Dissociation Energy and Geometry Optimisation


Albeit deceptively small and simple, the H$_2$ molecule with its two
protons and two electrons is already too big to derive an analytic
solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation. However, one may construct a
special basis set that is arbitrarily close to the complete basis set
limit, and then run a post-Hartree Fock calculation. Using such
techniques, it was found that, for the H$_2$ molecule,
$E_{exact} = -1.174474{}$ a.u.

In this set of exercises, you will compare the influence of basis sets
on the energy of H$_2$ at equilibrium distance, and you will then go on
to compute the dissociation energy of H$_2$ using Hartree Fock.

Subsequently, you will determine the equilibrium geometry of a species
using the example of water.
