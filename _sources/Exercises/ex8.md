# Finding Transition States and Barrier Heights: First Order Saddle Points


So far, you have already considered several systems that did not reside
in a minimum of the potential energy surface. Both the bond breaking in
the dissociation of H$_2$ as well as the internal rotation of butane
were examples of off-equilibrium processes, where the system moves from
one equilibrium conformer, *i.e.* from one minimum, to another. It is
intuitively clear that the likelihood of two equilibrium conformers to
be transformed into each other by moving along *some* random path is
negligible, and different methods have been established to find
reasonable paths for such transitions. A frequently used approach is
*transition state theory*, which is concerned with finding a realistic
path between potential energy minima. In this set of exercises, you will
search for the transition state for a the cyclisation of a deprotonated
chloropropanol to propylene oxide, and you will find the minimum energy
path that connects reactants to products via this transition state.
