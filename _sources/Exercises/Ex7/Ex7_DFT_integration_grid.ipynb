Some of the description is based on [the Q-Chem manual](https://manual.q-chem.com/5.4/qchem_manual.pdf) and [a 2019 working paper](http://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.8864204.v5).\n", "\n", "In order to do DFT calculations we use an integration grid when evaluating the exchange\u2013correlation integrals as there is no analytical form of the integrals. There are many integration schemes around. Most of them calculate the integrals as weighted sum over a finite amount of grid points generally defined on the surface of a sphere. The \u201cthickness\u201d of these grids is usually represented by the corresponding number of radial and angular points. The choice of the grid can significantly affect the computed results.\n", "The SG-0 and SG-1 (pruned 50,194 with < 40% of the points of the full grid) grids were optimized for an integration error in the energy to fall below a target threshold. Unfortunately, derivatives of the energy (eg. (hyper)polarizabilities) are often more sensitive to the quality of the integration grid. \n", "This is also true when imaginary vibrational frequencies or PES curves of non-bonded interactions are are calculated. A lack of rotational invariance in an integration grid can also yield uncertainities in isomerization reactions for example. If the grid is low quality,  low-frequency (but real) vibrational frequencies might manifest as imaginary and PES curves might contain artefacts.\n", "\n", "More recent functionals developed since ~2005 often depend on the kinetic energy density or the laplacian of the density (e.g Meta-GGA functionals) and require finer grids than GGA functionals. \n", "\n", "The issue of choosing the most appropriate integration grid is often overlooked. Relying on the default settings of quantum chemistry programs is not a good idea, even if some developers implemented variable grid requirements that depend on the chosen functional (e.g in Q-Chem). In this experiment we will look at the dissociation curve of the argon dimer, between 3.0 and 6.0 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m using psi4 which uses the medium quality 75, 302 grid as default. \n", "\n", "We will test two functionals: `b3lyp` and  `m06-hf`. \n", "\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "metadata": {"execution": {"iopub.execute_input": "2023-12-08T08:07:00.632939Z", "iopub.status.busy": "2023-12-08T08:07:00.629662Z", "iopub.status.idle": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.935501Z", "shell.execute_reply": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.933139Z", "shell.execute_reply.started": "2023-12-08T08:07:00.632794Z"}, "tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import psi4\n", "import pandas as pd \n", "import numpy as np \n", "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 2, "metadata": {"execution": {"iopub.execute_input": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.938751Z", "iopub.status.busy": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.938154Z", "iopub.status.idle": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.946649Z", "shell.execute_reply": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.944946Z", "shell.execute_reply.started": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.938710Z"}, "tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Lets create the distances we will be looking at\n", "distances = np.linspace(3, 6, 31)"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 3, "metadata": {"execution": {"iopub.execute_input": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.948523Z", "iopub.status.busy": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.948103Z", "iopub.status.idle": "2023-12-08T08:07:08.251665Z", "shell.execute_reply": "2023-12-08T08:07:08.249192Z", "shell.execute_reply.started": "2023-12-08T08:07:07.948490Z"}, "tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ["reference = [2.24,1.21, 0.57, 0.18, -0.06, -0.19, -0.26, -0.28, -0.28 , -0.27, -0.25, -0.23, -0.21, -0.18, -0.16, -0.14, -0.13, -0.11, -0.10, -0.09, -0.08, -0.07, -0.06, -0.05, -0.05, -0.04, -0.04, -0.03, -0.03, -0.03, -0.02]"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## BLYP functional"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 4, "metadata": {"execution": {"iopub.execute_input": "2023-12-08T08:07:08.256937Z", "iopub.status.busy": "2023-12-08T08:07:08.256185Z", "iopub.status.idle": "2023-12-08T08:19:19.776940Z", "shell.execute_reply": "2023-12-08T08:19:19.756739Z", "shell.execute_reply.started": "2023-12-08T08:07:08.256873Z"}, "tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ["psi4.core.clean()\n", "psi4.core.clean_options()\n", "psi4.core.set_output_file('grid.log', False)\n", "functional = \"b3lyp\" # b3lyp and m06-hf\n", "energies = {}\n", "distances = np.linspace(3, 6, 31)\n", "\n", "grid_options = {\n", "    'sg1':{'dft_grid_name':'sg1'},\n", "    '75-302':{'dft_radial_points':75, 'dft_spherical_points': 302},\n", "    '99-590':{'dft_radial_points':99, 'dft_spherical_points': 590}\n", "}\n", "\n", "for grid in grid_options.keys():\n", "    psi4.core.clean_options()\n", "    psi4.set_options(grid_options[grid])\n", "\n", "    energies[grid] = []\n", "\n", "    for R in distances:\n", "        # Argon Dimer Z-Matrix\n", "        ar_dimer = psi4.geometry(f\"\"\"\n", "        0 1\n", "        Ar \n", "        Ar 1 {R}\n", "        \"\"\")\n", "        energies[grid].append(psi4.energy(functional+\"/def2-QZVP\", molecule=ar_dimer))\n", "    "]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 5, "metadata": {"execution": {"iopub.execute_input": "2023-12-08T08:19:19.783046Z", "iopub.status.busy": "2023-12-08T08:19:19.782187Z", "iopub.status.idle": "2023-12-08T08:19:21.940011Z", "shell.execute_reply": "2023-12-08T08:19:21.937529Z", "shell.execute_reply.started": "2023-12-08T08:19:19.782965Z"}, "tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Calculate energy of single Argon atom\n", "psi4.core.clean_options()\n", "ar = psi4.geometry(\"\"\"\n", "Ar 0 0 0\n", "\"\"\")\n", "\n", "E_ar = psi4.energy(functional+\"/def2-QZVP\", molecule = ar)"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ["fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n", "ax.set_title(functional)\n", "# we plot the curves for each grid we used \n", "for grid in grid_options.keys():\n", "    # the interaction energy is the E_dimer -
