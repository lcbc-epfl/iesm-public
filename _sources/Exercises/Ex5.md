All methods discussed so far evaluate the energy of a system based on
its wavefunction $\Psi$; a purely mathematical object that lacks any
direct physical interpretation. In the next two sets of exercises, you
will explore a formalism that is based on a physical observable, called
*Density Functional Theory* (DFT). Rather than linking observables to
abstract wavefunctions, DFT relates any observable to a physical,
measurable quantity, the electron density $\rho$ (*cf.* figure 1). In
the next two sets of exercises, you will assess the performance of
various state-of-the-art density functionals in the prediction of
reaction enthalpies and geometric properties, and you will compare your
results to both wavefunction theory and experimental data. The first
exercise constitutes more of a practical introduction; you will be
provided with more ample theoretical information on DFT in the following
week.
