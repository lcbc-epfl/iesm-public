# Post-Hartree Fock Methods: MPn and Configuration Interaction


In the limit of a complete basis, the Hartree-Fock (HF) energy in the
complete basis set limit ($E_{CBS}^{HF}$) yields an upper boundary to
the physical energy of the system: 

$$\begin{aligned}
E^{total} = E^{HF}_{CBS} + E^{corr},\end{aligned}$$

 where the difference
between the total and the Hartree-Fock energy is given by effects due to
*electron correlation*, $E^{corr}$. The neglect of electron correlation
in Hartree-Fock is a consequence of the restriction to a single Slater
determinant. In weakly correlated systems, this may be a reasonable
approximation; in the majority of the cases, however, this approximation
breaks down more or less drastically. In such cases, it is inevitable to
include electron correlation; Hartree-Fock results may, in the worst
case, be almost (or even totally) meaningless (recall that Hartree-Fock
predicts a non-bonding F$_2$), since the the contribution of correlation
is significant in these systems. Inclusion of correlation can be based
on *e.g.* *Post-Hartree-Fock methods*, such as *Configuration
Interaction* (CI) or *MÃ¸ller Plesset Perturbation Theory* of n$^{th}$
order (MPn). In this set of exercises, you will compare the performance
of HF, MPn and CI in describing a bond dissociation energy, and you will
assess the influence of electron correlation on structural parameters
(bond lengths and angles).
