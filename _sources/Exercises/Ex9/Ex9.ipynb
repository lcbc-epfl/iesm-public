Correct the parameters adapting the conformation to be reasonably close to the transition state: for the TS, one expects that the C-Cl bond will already be elongated, whereas the oxygen atom will start to form the epoxide ring. Change the bond angle of the oxygen atom to something smaller than the original value, such as 80\u25e6, and modify the bond length for the C-Cl bond to an elongated conformation, such as 2.40 \u00c5.
