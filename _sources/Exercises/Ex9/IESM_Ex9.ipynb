How to verify whether you have found a meaningful transition state?***\n", "\n", "Forward Barrier Height: Compute the electronic energy (or Gibbs free energy if considering temperature effects) of the transition state (TS) and the reactants.\n", "\n", "From the TS it is necessary to find a minimum energy reaction path on the PES joining the reactants with the TS and the TS with the products. TS corresponds to a saddle point of the PES, this can be verified through the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The TS found should be a maximum of the PES over the reaction coordinate.\n", "\n", "Verify the Found Transition State:\n", "- Frequency Analysis:\n", "Perform a vibrational frequency analysis on the TS structure. A true transition state will have exactly one imaginary frequency (negative eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix). This frequency corresponds to the reaction coordinate.\n", "- Mode Visualization:\n", "Visualize the vibrational mode corresponding to the imaginary frequency.\n", "Ensure that this mode represents the movement along the expected reaction coordinate (e.g., bond-breaking or bond-forming).\n", "- Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) Calculation:\n", "Perform an IRC calculation starting from the TS. Following the negative Hessian eigenvalues from the transition state to the next local minimum, the IRC should connect the TS to the correct reactants and products, confirming it is on the reaction pathway.\n", "\n", "3. ***In Exercise 7, why is the barrier for the epoxide formation so low?***\n", "\n", "- The barrier is low because with the IRC profile we are joining the intermediate state of the epoxide formation (where the H in the OH group is already removed) with the final state.\n", "- Moreover, we are calculating the potential energy, and not the free energy. This also influence the result since the proper PES (using the free energy) is smoother than the one that would be obtained with the energy alone. Thermal energy might help the reaction overcome the barrier easily.\n", "\n", "4. ***In the course, we have seen many methods to calculate the electronic structures.
