# Potential Energy Scans and Visualisation of Trajectories


The range of problems that can be tackled with Psi4 or other electronic structure packages is not limited
to wavefunction or geometry optimisations. We can use python to create complex inputs, adjusting various settings, or making specific modifications of
some variables. 

In this set of exercises, you will instruct Psi4 to
selectively scan one degree of freedom of a potential energy surface.
